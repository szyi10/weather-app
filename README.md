The app then retrieves the weather data from the API and displays it on the screen, providing users with up-to-date weather information for any location they choose. The app is designed to be user-friendly and provides a convenient way for users to stay informed about the weather in different locations. Overall, this project is an efficient and practical tool for anyone looking for accurate and timely weather information.
